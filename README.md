# qu-slides: LaTeX Beamer Class and Presentation Template for Queen's University

This template provides a simple and clean [LaTeX Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) class to approximately look like the [visual identity](https://www.queensu.ca/brand-central/) standard for [Queenâ€™s University](http://www.queensu.ca) at Kingston, Ontario, Canada. 

This LaTeX template is particularly useful for technical presentations involving maths and code snippets.  Video is currently not supported.

## Example Output

See the [example PDF output](qu-slides-example.pdf) included in this repository.

## Dependencies

This template requires a number of packages, each loaded in the [qu-slides.cls](qu-slides.cls) file.  Most notably, the Queen's standard font is the free font [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), which this template incorporates by using the [opensans package](https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/opensans/).

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

This template includes functionality for syntax highlighting of code snippets using the [minted](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted) package.  Overleaf has a nice [introduction to minted](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_Highlighting_with_minted).

Minted requires the installation of additional software, Pygments.  Section 2.1 of [the minted documentation](https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf) describes how to install Pygments.  If you use macOS, the easiest way is probably to just [install Pygments using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pygments#default).

When running LaTeX and using minted, you must invoke it with the `-shell-escape` flag so that it can access Pygments.  For example, if you are using Visual Studio Code as an IDE with the LaTeX Workshop extension and compile your document using `latexmk`, then you can edit the `settings.json` package to include the flag, as shown in the example snippet below.

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.tools":[
    {
        "name": "latexmk",
        "command": "latexmk",
        "args": [
            "-shell-escape",
            "-synctex=1",
            "-interaction=nonstopmode",
            "-file-line-error",
            "-pdf",
            "-outdir=%OUTDIR%",
            "%DOC%"
        ],
        "env": {}
    },
```

If you do not need this functionality, then you can simply comment out these lines shown below in the [qu-slides.cls](qu-slides.cls) file and be sure to not use minted commands in your document.

```latex
% For code snippets in your slides
\RequirePackage{minted}
\setminted[python]{linenos=true}
\setminted[cpp]{linenos=true}
\renewcommand\theFancyVerbLine{\sffamily\scriptsize\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}
```
